# Munz Addr Browser Extension (Firefox version)

## Introduction

[Munzee](https://www.munzee.com) info pages used to display the approximate address of the Munzee's coordinates below the mini map. This feature seems to have been dropped after the switchover from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap.

Munz Addr is a Firefox extension that uses the [Bing Maps API](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) to reverse-geocode a Munzee's coordinates and adds the resulting street address below the mini map, where it used to be.
